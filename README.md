**Hi, and thanks for stopping by.** This GitHub organisation is run by the admins of the /r/GameMaker Discord server. The manager of this organisation, and the primary **point of contact** for enquiries, is **Sidorakh** (Sidorakh#8297 / @Sidorakh).

Do you have an **example, library, or game** that you think would be a great addition to the GitHub? That's great! We'd love it if you wanted to submit it to this GitHub organisation.

&nbsp;

<h3 align="center">What we're looking for in submissions are:</h3>

1. Examples of accessible, time-tested GameMaker techniques

2. Well-written and well-commented examples of novel and interesting techniques

3. Finished game project files that demonstrate novel and interesting techniques

&nbsp;

<h3 align="center">I'm interested, how do I submit a project?</h3>

**Submissions must be made to Sidorakh via a DM on Discord.** The easiest way to get in touch is to **join our server**
(https://discord.gg/By6u9pC). Once you have sent your submission directly to Sidorakh, **we will review the submission**, and one of three things will happen:

1. **The submission is declined** because it doesn't fit with the guidelines or checklist, or isn't a good fit for this GitHub organisation overall. 

2. **Modifications to the submission are requested.** This would happen when a submission is a good fit for the GitHub, but doesn't meet the guidelines.

3. **The submission is accepted** and you will be allowed to **transfer the repo** to the GitHub organisation.

If that was a little hard to follow, don't worry, we have a **handy flowchart** at the bottom of this document.

&nbsp;

:ballot_box_with_check: Is your submission novel work that demonstrates a new technique, or is it a clear example of an old technique?
